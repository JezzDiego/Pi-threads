The objective of this project is to better understand the concept of threads and how they can be used to better utilize the processing resources available in modern computers. To do this, a C program will be built using the Posix Threads library to calculate Pi using N simultaneous threads. The value of Pi can be approximated by the Leibniz-Gr√©gory series:
